# NeuralNetLib
These files include my own implementation of a neural network to be used in my other projects.

Activating the Makefile will compile a set of .o output files.
Note: See my other repos like "Perceptron" for an actual program using the neural network

I will continue to update these classes in order to improve the learning/convergence speed.

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.
